        <p><h4>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato
            sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna 
            filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd 
            cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green 
            salad and crusty garlic bread.</h4></p>
        <p><h3>Ingredients list</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ul>-½ pound ground pork</ul>
            <ul>-½ pound lean ground beef</ul>
            <ul>-½ cup minced onion</ul>
            <ul>-1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</ul>
            <ul>-1 (8 ounce) can tomato sauce</ul>
            <ul>-2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</ul>
            <ul>-1 clove garlic, crushed</ul>
            <ul>-1 ½ teaspoons dried basil</ul>
            <ul>-1 ½ teaspoons salt</ul>
            <ul>-½ teaspoon dried oregano</ul>
            <ul>-⅛ teaspoon white sugar</ul>
            <ul>-1 (16 ounce) package lasagna noodles</ul>
            <ul>-1 pound small-curd cottage cheese</ul>
            <ul>-¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</ul>
            <ul>-3 large eggs</ul>
            <ul>-2 teaspoons salt</ul>
            <ul>-¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</ul>
            <ul>-1 (16 ounce) package shredded mozzarella cheese</ul>
        </p> 
        <p><h3>Cooking steps</h3></p>
        <p>
            <ol><h4>Step 1</h4>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 2</h4>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 3</h4>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 4</h4>While the noodles are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 5</h4>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 6</h4>ssemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 7</h4>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</ol>
            <ol><h4>Step 8</h4>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</ol>
